# Ubuntu Notification Shortcut
This is a simple bash script that enables/disables the notifications area.

By default, there is no exising shortcut for this, even if there is a toggle for enable/disable. so we need to use the shortcut.

# Installation
Clone the repository or copy the file manually.. Place it somewhere in the file system.
Make the file executable with
`sudo chmod +x ubuntu-notification-shortcut`

Open the `Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcodes > Custom Shortoces`
Set the name of the command, place the path to file, e.g. `~/Software//ubuntu-notification-shortcut` and select the keyboard combination

That's it.
